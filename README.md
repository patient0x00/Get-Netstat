# Get-Netstat
Powershell parsing of netstat output

SYNOPSIS
	
	PowerShell parsing of netstat output. Resulting output are objects rather than text.

DESCRIPTION
	
	Runs Netstat command and parses results into seperate objects. Combines information with additional
	parameters including Path, Start Time, and associated Modules.

PARAMETER 'Elevated'
	
	Specify this switch if running from an elevated shell. If elevated Netstat is run with the following
	switches -abfno. If running in a non-elevated shell Netstat is run with the following switches -afno.
	The '-b' switch requires elevation. The '-b' switch adds the information of the associated process
	or executable.

EXAMPLE
	
	PS > Get-Netstat | Out-Gridview

	Will output into the gridview for sorting.

EXAMPLE
	
	PS > Get-Netstat | ForEach {Get-Process -Id $_.PID}

	Since Netstat parameters are now objects, they can be passed in the pipeline.
